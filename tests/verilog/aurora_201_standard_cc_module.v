//  STANDARD CC MODULE
//
//
//  Description: This module drives the Aurora module's Clock Compensation 
//               interface. Clock Compensation sequences are generated according
//               to the requirements in the Aurora Protocol specification.
//                  
//               This module supports Aurora Modules with any number of 
//               2-byte lanes and no User Flow Control.
//
