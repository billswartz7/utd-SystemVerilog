@post The yy_preproc and yy_verilog_source_tree objects are not NULL, and

@brief Perform a parsing operation on the supplied file.
@details Parses the supplied file object, adding any parsed constructs to
the existing yy_verilog_source_tree object, and using the existing
yy_preproc preprocessor context.
@param [in] to_parse - The open file object to be parsed.
@pre yy_init has been called atleast once, and to_parse is an open and
valid file to be read.
@post Any valid verilog constructs have been added to the 
yy_verilog_source_tree global object.
@returns An integer describing the result of the parse operation. If 
the return value is a zero, the file was parsed successfully. If it takes
any other value, the file parsed was syntactically invalid.
@note In the event of an invalid file being parsed, then the 
yy_verilog_source_tree object will only contain upto, but not including,
the most recently valid parsed object. For example, when the following
source is parsed:

    module valid_module();
