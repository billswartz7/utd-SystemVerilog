@brief A simple wrapper around calloc.
@details This function is identical to calloc, but uses the head and
walker variables above to keep a linked list of all heap memory that the
AST construction allocates. This makes it very easy to clean up afterward
using the @ref ast_free_all function.
@param [in] num - Number of elements to allocate space for.
@param [in] size - The size of each element being allocated.
@returns A pointer to the start of the block of memory allocated.
